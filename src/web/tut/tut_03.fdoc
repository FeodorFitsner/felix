@title Command Line Arguments

@h1 Command line arguments

Another way to change the name that displays on our hello world program is to use command line arguments.
These arguments are supplied when the program is run from the command line, as follows:

<pre>
flx hello v1 v2 v3 v4
</pre>

With @{v1} having an index of 1, @{v2} of 2, and so on, counting up by one.
We can grab these values by passing the index value (position) into @{System::argv} as we see here:

@felix-unchecked
println$ "Hello " + System::argv 1;
@

This reads the first command line argument (index=1), and returns it to the caller.
For example if you type:

<pre>
flx hello Joachim
</pre>

then Joachim will be welcomed (i.e. "Hello Joachim").

<ul>

<li>
The function @{System::argv} applied to an integer <em>n</em> returns the <em>n'th</em> command line argument.
If the argument exists it will return it (as a string), or an empty string otherwise.
</li> 

<li>
Arguments actually start at an index of 0, but this always contains the executable name.
If you play with this you'll notice something funny though, this value does not include the @{flx} driver.
As an exercise for the reader, find an explanation why this is true.
</li>

</ul>
