@h1 Environment variables
It's a pretty boring program, so lets try an improvement:
@felix-unchecked
println$ "Hello " + Env::getenv "USER";
@
<ul><li>The @{getenv} function can't fail, it will just return an empty string
of the environment variable is not set.</li>
<li> The infix operator @{+} you
see is string concatenation.</li>
</ul>
